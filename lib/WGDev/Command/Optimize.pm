your site config file, which is located at:

Keep in mind:
*) Some assets such as FilePile will not appear in your Assets table but
   are still used to provide funcitonality (in the case of FilePile 
   providing a way for users to upload multiple Files).

   for example the mailFooter setting in the Settings table

To reduce row count, you may want to investigate deleting old/unused data.
To reduce row size, apart from deleting rows, you might want to investigate mysql's "optimize table" command.
